You do not need GitHub to use git
Git= Local on the computer
GitHub= Remote on the web

###
mkdir ~/test-repo
cd ~/test-repo
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/crypthexon/test-repo.git

On your computer, move the file you'd like to upload to GitHub into the local directory that was created when you cloned the repository.
Open Git Bash.

Change the current working directory to your local repository.

Stage the file for the first commit to your repository.



### 
The following steps pushes from local repo to remote repo

Steps: Add > Commit > Push

git add . "adds all files"
git add -u "updates tracking for files that changes names or were deleted"
git add -A does both of the previous

# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.

git commit -m "First commit"
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.

git push origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin

or, use the followings:

	
This can cause the remote repository to lose commits; use it with care.
If you do not wish to merge the remote branch into your local branch (see differences with git diff), and want to do a force push, use the push command with -f

git push -f origin <branch>
where origin is the name of your remote repo.

###
